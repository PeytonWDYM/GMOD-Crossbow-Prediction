# Garry's Mod Crossbow Prediction! 
## As said in the title, it predicts where the crossbow bolt is gonna end up!
## There's a lot of features such as: bolt cam, multiple visualization options, seeing where other people's crossbow bolt is gonna end up, **tickrate based prediction for maximum accuracy** and much more.
## This is one of my first fully made projects made using GMOD GLua. It was fun! I will definitely add more stuff to this.

## -------------------

# Instructions.
## 1. Download server and client .lua files
## 2. Put the said files in their /lua/autorun directory 
## 3. Done!

## -------------------

# Extra Stuff to know / stuff that I noticed while making this script.
## The default values for the client crossbow prediction settings can be changed with little lua experience in the client .lua file.
## The crossbow prediction isnt 100% accurate and I believe that is due to either the fact that the crossbow bolt itself, upon bounce, will slightly go into the ground, offsetting the bolt just a bit, or, the varying tickrate on servers. Who knows.
## Feel free to contribute!
